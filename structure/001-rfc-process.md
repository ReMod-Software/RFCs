# RFC Process

This document aims to define the RFC process for ReMod Software, and all of the
projects that fall under its name.


# Reasoning

ReMod has been plagued with management issues over the course of its lifespan.
This change is being made to formalize its changes and project structure.


# Explanation 

The RFC process goes as follows:
- User wants to make a change
- User forks the RFC repo and makes said change
- User creates a pull request, with the RFC number being the pull request number
- Everyone comments about the change
- Everyone votes on merging the change
- If a change is merged, it goes into effect immediately
